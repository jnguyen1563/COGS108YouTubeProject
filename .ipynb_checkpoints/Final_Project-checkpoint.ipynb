    "#Overview\n",
    "YouTube - What can a channel do to further increase their viewer, subscriber, and follow count? As such, we had questions like : \n",
    "* When publishing a video, what type of title is the best, and when should it be posted to ensure maximized number of views and increase of subscriber counter?\n",
    "* What forms of social media should the video be shared on in order to further increase viewer, subscriber, and follow count?\n",
    "* What length should videos be, in order to maximize ad revenue, viewer counts, likes, and subscribers, alongside promoting channel growth and generating profit?\n",
    "\n",
    "But this wasn’t as low-level as we’d like so in order to be more specific in our questions, we decided to narrow down on YouTube videos categorically. When sifting through the datasets, we found that many of these categories had many observations, though some were lacking in observations and interest. The category we chose, How-to and Style was enticing because it concerned itself with clickbait, creativity, and the creator’s skill.\n"

    "* Where did we find the dataset\n",
    " * We found the dataset off of Kaggle, we were perusing through their already published datasets.\n",
    "* Why do we choose to use YouTube datasets\n",
    " * We chose to use YouTube datasets because everyone today uses YouTube. For those that want to delve into the world of content creation, specifically into How-to and Style content, making great content that balance revenue and growth would be of paramount priority. \n",
    " * There’s a lot of data to use.\n",
    "* Why did we choose to use How To & Style category \n",
    " * There were many factors that we put into selecting this category. As we were sifting through the many categories with many observations in our dataset(1000+), we found that a lot of them were just uninteresting (News and Politics) or required a certain amount of prestige (Entertainment, in the case of it being filled with movie trailers). Therefore, we narrowed it down into How To & Style because it revolved around the creativity of the content creator (what kind of nifty tools they could make out of household products, etc). As such, this category would require certain levels of creativity and skill to thrive, but will clickbait offset this?\n",
